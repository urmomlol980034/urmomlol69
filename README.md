### SSL/TLS:
Taco Proxy is encrypted with the latest TLS 1.3

Since Heroku does not support SSL Certificates for free dynos, the next best alternative is using CloudFare Flexible.

### Email Address Obfuscation
CloudFare will attempt to obfuscate email addresses on Taco Proxy to prevent harvesting by bots and spammers
